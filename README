Final Project: Spooky Quest


Control your army of skeletons to reclaim the cemetary from the mummies.

To run: Run "spooky.py".


New skeletons can be summoned from spaces next to bone piles. 
It is suggested to summon your skeletons before you use the last skeleton each turn.
New bone piles can be made by destroying a skeleton with another skeleton.

Most of the controls are located in-game on the right panel.
Other controls include "Esc" to escape and the directional keys to move.

If you want the characters to walk in place while moving set ANIMATION in constant.py to True.
Note that this makes the game very gittery on slow computers.

The AI for the Enemy is very bad. It often gets stuck or does stupid things.
However, the goal for this project was not to focus on AI.

Some features that I wanted to include that I didn't have time for include:
	Multiple classes of units with different stats and methods of movement/attacking
	Enemies that get stronger as you destroy Tombstones
